        <p id="para">Rockstar Games, Inc. is an American video game publisher based in New York City.
             The company was established in December 1998 as a subsidiary of Take-Two Interactive, using the assets
              Take-Two had previously acquired from BMG Interactive. Founding members of the company were Terry Donovan,
               Gary Foreman, Dan and Sam Houser, and Jamie King, who worked for Take-Two at the time, and of which the Houser
                brothers were previously executives at BMG Interactive. Sam Houser heads the studio as president. <br><br>

            Since 1999, several companies acquired by or established under Take-Two have become part of Rockstar Games, 
            such as Rockstar Canada (later renamed Rockstar Toronto) becoming the first one in 1999, and Rockstar Dundee 
            the most recent in 2020. All companies organized under Rockstar Games bear the "Rockstar" name and logo. In this 
            context, Rockstar Games is sometimes also referred to as Rockstar New York, Rockstar NY or Rockstar NYC. Rockstar 
            Games also sports a motion capture studio in Bethpage, New York. <br><br>
            
            Rockstar Games predominantly publishes games in the action-adventure genre, while racing games
             also saw success for the company. One of such action-adventure game franchises is Grand Theft Auto,
              which Rockstar Games took over from BMG Interactive, which published the series' original 1997 entry. 
              The most recent main game in the series, Grand Theft Auto V, has sold over 155 million copies since its 
              release in September 2013, making it one of the best-selling video games of all time. Other popular franchises
               published by Rockstar Games are Red Dead, Midnight Club, Max Payne and Manhunt..</p>

            <h1>Fact Check</h1>
            <p>Back when GTA 5 was released, it was reported that the game hit the $1,000,000,000 threshold in just three days. 
                 was a new record back then, and it's not surprising to see why GTA 5 has made so much money. <br><br>
                This fact can be considered somewhat lesser-known today because GTA 5 has been out for nearly a decade. 
                There's a new generation of gamers who have only started to play GTA 5 recently, so they weren't there when
                 the game was released. <br><br>
                On a side note, the recent pandemic has done wonders for GTA 5 in terms of recent sales, almost paralleling 2013's
                 launch in terms of sheer copies sold.</p>
